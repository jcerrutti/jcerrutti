### Hi! My name is Juan ðŸ‘‹
#### I'm a Frontend Developer who enjoys learning new technologies and buys domains without using it.

My favorite language by far is __JavaScript__, and my passion is to understand more about the foundations and why _NaN is a number_ ðŸ¤”.

I'm currently working at Mercado Libre, but making the move to work on some amazing projects at [Ring.com](https://www.ring.com) with React Native.
